# alerting is implemented in form of simple POST requests with json payload
# you can use and/or adapt the predefined Slack/OpsGenie/Keybase templates and the examples below
# to channel alert notifications to Slack/OpsGenie/Keybase or create a custom template for a customized alert
# payload to use with a simple POST request to the receiver_url to receive alerts.
# Parameters you can use in your templates are "alert_message", "priority", "connaisseur_pod_id", "cluster",
# "timestamp", "request_id" and "images" each one basically meaning what their names indicate
# Below is an example config
